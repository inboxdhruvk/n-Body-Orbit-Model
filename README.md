# n-Body-Orbit-Model
Used MATLAB and laws of universal gravitation to simulate the constantly changing movement of any number of celestial bodies or satellites, given initial positions and velocities. Currently working on incorporating thrust to model rocket launches and adding an indicator of center-of-mass to prove conservation of momentum.
